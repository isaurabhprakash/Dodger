# Dodger
VTU 6th Sem Graphics and Visualisation Laboratory Project

## Abstract
This project demonstrates the simple game of dodging. 
Earth is attacked by invading Aliens. 
The job of the player is to defend his/her planet. 
Spaceships start coming from space towards the player who has to shoot them before they touch his/herspaceship.
The project is mouse and keyboard interactive. Mouse is used to move the playerâ€™s spaceship. 
After each collision with the enemy spaceship, the health of the player decreases. As the health becomes zero, the game gets over.
Health and number of Special Weapons left is shown on the top left of the screen. Score is shown on the top right of the screen. 
Final Score is shown on the Game Over Screen and the user is given an option to restart the game.
